# This is Zhenyi Huang's repository 


## INTRODUCTION

Hello everyone, this is the repository I have created for the course **STAT 545A**
So what is a *repository* ?

According to **Wikipedia**, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)) 
>In revision control systems, a repository[1] is an on-disk data structure which stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure.
