## INTRODUCTION

### Repository

Hello everyone, this is the repository I have created for the course <a ref="http://stat545.com/Classroom/">STAT 545A</a>,
So what is a *repository* ??

According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repository_(version_control)"> Wikipedia </a>,

>In revision control systems, a repository[1] is an on-disk data structure which stores metadata for a set of files or directory structure.

In general, a repository could includes the following things:
- A historical record of changes in the repository.
- A set of commit objects.
- A set of references to commit objects, called heads.
